/* 
    This code is organized into regions to help readability


    This code handles 2 distinct tasks: 
    1) Outputs a force on the Haply Inverse3 from the Asset (targetAsset)
    2) Creates a suture object. 



    The suture object is dynamically created as a series of cylinder objects (threadPartition).
    This suture object includes an (optionally visible) dynamically created sphere at the meeting of two threadPartitions (joint)

    The threadPartition is created by starting a cylinder at one joint, and ending at the next. (n-1 thread partitions for n joints)





    GENERAL PROGRAM FLOW:
    OnDeviceStateChanged (called by Unity's internal Update function) -> QueueMainThreadAction -> CalculateForceOnMainThread -> CreateJointAtCollisionPoint

    OnButtonUp (subscribed from versegripcontroller) -> DeleteAllthreadPartitionssAndJoints

    OnButtonDown (subscribed from versegripcontroller) ->
